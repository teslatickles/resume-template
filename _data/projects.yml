  description: This DIY project came to fruition in response to a problem at home: my roommate/best friend didn't have a remote to his Samsung tv. So, I decided it would be "best" to build one using a microcontroller,
   buttons, infrared LED, and some arduino code. It would end up with my making one for my Sony television (I like its simplicity and aesthetic), with it evolving over time. The first iteration was bulkier, with the
   microcontroller being an Adafruit Trinket Pro. This was not only bulky, but completely unnecessary considering the requirements while also wasting power. The solution was using an ATtiny85 microcontroller chip,
   flashing the ATtiny with a firmware that allows a software serial connection to be allowed, then flashing the actually software to the ATtiny85 using an Arduino Uno with a custom circuit for flashing the chip.
